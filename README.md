# Diabetes Outcome Prediction - Regression Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a diabetes dataset with 768 entries and 8 features, predicting diabetes outcome through linear and polynomial regression. The work encompasses detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA), model evaluation, and interpretation of significant predictors.

## Project Structure
- **Dataset Information**: Describes the dataset's features, including glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, and other health indicators.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - **Univariate Analysis**: Visualizes distributions of features using histograms and box plots, identifying skewness and central tendency.
  - **Bivariate Analysis**: Uses scatter plots to explore relationships between features and the outcome variable.
  - **Multivariate Analysis**: Employs violin plots to compare distributions across diabetes outcomes.
  - **Correlation Analysis**: Provides insights into feature relationships through a correlation matrix.
- **Modeling and Evaluation**:
  - **Linear Regression**: Evaluates model performance with metrics such as MSE, RMSE, and R-squared.
  - **Polynomial Regression**: Tests a non-linear approach and compares it to linear regression results.
  - **Interpreting Coefficients**: Analyzes model coefficients to identify significant predictors and understand feature impacts.
  - **Goodness-of-Fit**: Assesses model fit with R-squared and residual analysis.

## Key Insights
- **Significant Predictors**: Features like glucose, BMI, age, and pregnancies showed strong associations with diabetes outcomes.
- **Model Performance**: Linear regression performed slightly better than polynomial regression, with an R-squared value of 0.255.
- **Interpretation**: Regression coefficients indicate the impact of each feature on the diabetes outcome, providing valuable insights for diabetes risk factors.

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates how regression models can provide predictive insights into diabetes outcomes and highlights significant health indicators. Future work could involve refining features, testing additional models, or improving feature engineering to enhance prediction accuracy.
